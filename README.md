This application is a basic to do list. To get this started, you need to install the node
modules. This assumes you already have node js and npm installed. If not, at this point,you should install it. 

1. Navigate to the project folder on your terminal and type npm install. 
2. The above commands installs the node modules. Your console will log that the serve is running on port 3000.
3. Open up your browser and navigate to localhost:3000
4. Start adding new list items and cross out already finished items by selecting the 
checkbox by the item.
5. Bonus feature enables you to delete items on the list. 
6. Additionally, I signed up for a free atlas account to test this on, you can replace the entire connection url with a new one or only modify the places that need modification like database user name and password fields. 

Feel free to use this project as a starter for more complex projects.
